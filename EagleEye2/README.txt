GENERAL USAGE NOTES
---------------------
This Android project is designed to allow any person to take a picture of an Embry Riddle building in the Daytona Beach campus and identify the name of the building. 

NOTE: This is an incomplete version meaning not all features will work, if any. Version 1.0 will be a complete application.

BEFORE YOU RUN
----------------
To install this app to a device, copy the app’s “debug.apk” file (located under EagleEye\EagleEye2\app\build\outputs\apk\) onto the device and click it to install. You will need to allow installation from unknown sources for this to work (this option should pop up once you click the app, if not you will have to change it in settings).

To build this app from the source code, open the project in Android Studio and click the play button. If you want to deploy to an emulator, created the emulator device in Android Studio’s Android Virtual Device Manager (AVD) and start the device, then use the play button as normal.
