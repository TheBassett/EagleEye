/**
 * This activity assists in trapping the camera's "State" e.g. where the camera plans
 * on saving it's resulting file and URI. This activity saves this information to the bundle
 * and retrieves it on resume. This is necessary because when the Android external camera starts,
 * the file path anf URI get collected and won't be available on resume, resulting in a crash.
 * <p/>
 * Samsung devices, in particular may crash if you don't do this:
