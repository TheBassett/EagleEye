    <string name="about_text">This app was designed for the Fall 2015 SE 300 class with Dr. Jafer by the following developers:\n\n
        Team Lead: Jessica Updegrove\n
        Android Lead: Alex Bassett\n
        Android Team: Alex Bassett, Jonathan Rach, Jessica Updegrove (assistance)\n
        Image Processing Team: Dean Laga, Joel Vande Polder, Jessica Updegrove (assistance)\n
        \nThis app is meant to be used on the ERAU DB campus to assist visitors, alumni, and new students as they
        explore the ever-changing campus. To use, take a picture of a building on campus and the app will process
        the image and return the name of the building. Additional features, such as a campus map and building directory
        will be added in future versions.\n\nHave fun and we hope you enjoy the app.</string>
